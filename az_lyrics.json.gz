down,\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.\n\nThis is looking like a contest,\nOf who can act like they care less,\nBut I liked it better when you were on my side.\nThe battle's in your hands now,\nBut I would lay my armor down\nIf you said you'd rather love than fight.\nSo many things that you wish I knew,\nBut the story of us might be ending soon.\n\n[Chorus:]\nNow I'm
